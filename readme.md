# Introduction

This is an example of a dataset as a package for r.
In [this blogpost](link) I show how to create a package for your data.

You don't have to share your package on github. It can live on your
computer a usb stick, a shared drive or where ever.
It can even stay on your computer alone, just to save you trouble.

Once installed you can access your data with library(yourpackage) and data("nameofdata")


In my case:
library(coffeedata)
data("coffeedata")  
Help information can be found with ?coffeedata or
vignette("coffeedata")
